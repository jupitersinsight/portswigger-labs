This lab is vulnerable due to a logic flaw in its brute-force protection.
To solve the lab, brute-force Carlos's password, then access his account page.



As the limit is based on the rate of HTTP requests sent from the user's IP address, it is sometimes also possible to bypass this defense if you can work out how to guess multiple passwords with a single request.



With Burp running, investigate the login page. Notice that the POST /login request submits the login credentials in JSON format. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
In Burp Repeater, replace the single string value of the password with an array of strings containing all of the candidate passwords. For example:

"username" : "carlos",
"password" : [
    "123456",
    "password",
    "qwerty"
    ...
]
Send the request. This will return a 302 response.
Right-click on this request and select Show response in browser. Copy the URL and load it in the browser. The page loads and you are logged in as carlos.
