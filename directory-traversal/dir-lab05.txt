Lab: File path traversal, validation of start of path

This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application transmits the full file path via a request parameter, and validates that the supplied path starts with the expected folder.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
